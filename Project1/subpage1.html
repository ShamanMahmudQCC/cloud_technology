        <p>While some phishing emails still have bad grammar and spelling mistakes, many scammers now make their messages look more real. They might copy professional-looking emails or get help from people who speak the language well. Sometimes, they focus more on tricking you into doing something quickly than on perfect spelling. So, it's not safe to just rely on spotting mistakes to know if an email is a scam. You should always be careful and watch out for other signs too.</p>
