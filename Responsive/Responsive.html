                <p>
                    Hello class,

                    I just want to remind you that the original policies regarding the due date of the activities/lab and homework in class is that if the student submits the lab/class activity after the due date they will have a grade of zero. However, some students have not yet entered any class/lab activity on HTML, without taking into account that HTML is the fundamental for creating the structure of a website.
                </p>

                <h2>Due Date</h2>
                <p>
                    All HTML activities are already grades. However, I am going to give one last opportunity for students to submit any missing lab/class activity, assignment, and homework and you have until Sunday, Feb 18, 2024 by midnight  to upload it to your GitHub account and make the link in the index.html file. 
                </p>

            <div class="cardinfo">
                <h2>Due Date</h2>
                <p>
                    But to be fair with students who submitted assignmens on-time, the grades for late submission will be a decrease of 20% of the grade. Any activities and assignments that you want to be submitted/resubmitted/regraded after Sunday will not be received and the student will receive a zero for each activity that is not submitted.

                    If you have any questions, please let me know during class or through email.

                    Best,

                    Prof. Wu
